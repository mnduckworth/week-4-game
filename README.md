# week-4-game

In this assinment I created a basic jQuery Based RPG that allows the user to select an initial characer and then somebody to attack.

After each attack the user loses health and gains damage based on the opponents counter-attack stats and a predefined damage increase bonus. 

If the user sucessfully defeats everyone without dropping below 0 health they win. If they drop below 0 health before defeating everyone they lose and are given the option to start over.
